# Star Wars API Characters Table App

#

## This Application written with pure javaScript and Axios for HTTP request.

#

### This application gives the ability of search to the users and users can find their favorite characters information super easily without browsing through the whole characters.

## Challenge

#

### This project was challenging for me and I struggled quite a bit to correctly access the API data and how to render it properly into my project, I learned a lot through the process and have gotten a lot more confident about programming with HTTP request with Axios and asynchronous code.
